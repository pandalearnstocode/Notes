# Network of trust

I recently saw a talk presented by Linus Torvalds in google talk. This talk was about the version control system. I am using this for quite few years now. I always thought that it was something which was developed may be in the late 80's to early 90's. But this talk was quite interesting for me. It gave me an idea that who larger problem it solved and that too within a very short time.
