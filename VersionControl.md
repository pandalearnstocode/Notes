# Version control for Data Science projects

Here in this article I am going to share my experience, that how it has affected my workflow and increased my productivity. Ofcourse there will be subjectivity in this article but there is no doubt that learning version control can bring efficiency to a data science project. I have studied theoritical statistics. As a part of my course I have always used computers for almost a decade in a academic setup. But we the statisticians community see computer as a advanced form of calculator which is not quite wrong in the academic setup. One has to understand that with a regour of studing one subject does not allow individuals to learn the other one with very much sophistication. When both the deciplie has a huge amount of stuffs to learn. But saying this I have always stuggled that how can I make changes in a efficient manner. Like most of my other batch mates I used to have a folder and inside that we use to store a same file with different prefix or suffix. Now, this solves the problem for a single assignment with multiple function may be but definately it was not the best way to keep track of thing. Another thing which I have done multiple amount of time is that I use to comment and uncomment things in the same file and when I am happy with the work I use to make a final copy of the code and store it in a file. Again this thing solves problem in a small setup but as a statistican yet if you have not been expose to the large amount of complexity of a system then trust me this is not the best way to go forward for file management. 

The people from computer science domain face this issue quite more often that as a community statisticans do and they have solved this problem in a quite robust manner. The answer is version controlling. There are serveral tools avaiable online which can be used for this purpose.
