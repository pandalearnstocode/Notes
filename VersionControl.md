# Version control for Data Science projects

Here in this article I am going to share my experience, that how version control system has affected my daily workflow and increased my productivity. Ofcourse there will be a great amount subjectivity involved in this article but there is no doubt that learning version control can bring efficiency to a data science project. I have studied theoritical statistics in school. During my days in university I have always used computers for almost a decade in a academic setup. But I think, we the statisticians as community mostly see computer as an advanced form of calculator. Frankly is not quite wrong in the academic setup. One has to understand that with a regour of studing one subject does not allow an individuals to learn the other one with very much sophistication. When both the deciplie has a huge amount of stuffs to learn. But saying this I have always stuggled that how can I make changes in a efficient manner. Like most of my other batch mates I used to have a folder and inside that we use to store a same file with different prefix or suffix. Now, this solves the problem for a single assignment with multiple function may be but definately it was not the best way to keep track of thing. Another thing which I have done multiple amount of time is that I use to comment and uncomment things in the same file and when I am happy with the work I use to make a final copy of the code and store it in a file. Again this thing solves problem in a small setup but as a statistican yet if you have not been expose to the large amount of complexity of a system then trust me this is not the best way to go forward for file management. 

The people from computer science domain face this issue quite more often that as a community statisticans do and they have solved this problem in a quite robust manner. The answer is version controlling. There are serveral tools avaiable online which can be used for this purpose.
